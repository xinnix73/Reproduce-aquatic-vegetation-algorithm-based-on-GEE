I try to reprodue an automatic classification algorithm of aquatic vegetation in GEE from "An automatic classification algorithm for submerged aquatic vegetation in shallow lakes using Landsat imagery‚Äù(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112459)
The code is rough but basically implements the functions in the article.
You can test by "https://code.earthengine.google.com/e866b0c99a7ece382f97857f0712eade" (based on Landsat) and "https://code.earthengine.google.com/9842e533aae09768f26de85bd17bd6b3" (based on Sentinel-2)
